The o-grid mesh file for one of the cases can be found in this folder.
There are a total of 14 files, compressed under two zip folders: Mesh001 and Mesh002. 
Hence, Mesh001 and Mesh002 are needed to be extracted before using them. 
The extracted files can be directly accessed in ICEM-CFD, using the commands: File > Open Project > Beta_loop
